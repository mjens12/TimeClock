Time Clock
This is a digital punch card for a single week, allowing the user to input the time they “clocked-in” for work and the time they “clocked-out” of work.
Once times are entered, there is a “Time Worked” category to show them the total hours they worked for each day, and a “Weekly Total” category to show how many hours worked total.
Once the user’s hours have been logged, there is an option to enter in an hourly pay rate, that will calculate how much money they made during this week.
The user will be shown gross pay (amount before tax deductions), and a net pay (amount received after tax deductions).
There are four tax fields for the user to change how much taxes will be taken out of their check.
If the tax entered totals more than 100%, there will be an error thrown, not allowing negative money to be given to the user.
The interface also includes a menu that allows the user to export their time worked to a readable text-file.
Also included in the menu is a reset button that clears all entered time values. We’ve created checkboxes next to every day of the week, allowing the user to uncheck and disable any days they didn’t work that week.
Lastly, we’ve added a currency converter, that takes how much money you’ve made in USD, to six other global currencies.
